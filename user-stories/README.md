# Airbnb Clone Backend – User Stories Documentation

This directory contains the **User Stories** derived from the **Use Case Diagram** of the Airbnb Clone Backend project.  
Each story represents a functional requirement written from the user’s perspective.

## Files Included
- **user-stories.md** – The complete set of user stories describing system interactions.

## Purpose
User stories help the development team understand:
- What users want to achieve.
- Why each feature is important.
- How the backend should respond to user goals.

## Relation to Use Case Diagram
The user stories are a direct textual translation of the **Use Case Diagram** designed in the previous task.  
They describe the exact system behavior that each actor interacts with — including Guests, Hosts, Admins, and external systems.
